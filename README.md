Hypothesis testing lets you answer questions about your datasets in a statistically rigorous way. In this course, you'll grow your Python analytical skills as you learn how and when to use common tests like t-tests, proportion tests, and chi-square tests. Working with real-world data, including Stack Overflow user feedback and supply-chain data for medical supply shipments, you'll gain a deep understanding of how these tests work and the key assumptions that underpin them. You'll also discover how non-parametric tests can be used to go beyond the limitations of traditional hypothesis tests.
